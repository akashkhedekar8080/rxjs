# RxJS Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation and demonstration of [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), a powerful library for reactive programming using Observables. It showcases various RxJS functionalities, stream manipulations, and best practices for managing asynchronous data flows.

## Features

- Core RxJS concepts: Observables, Observers, and Subjects.
- Demonstrations of essential RxJS operators: `map`, `filter`, `merge`, `concat`, `switchMap`, and more.
- Examples illustrating reactive programming patterns.
- Efficient handling of asynchronous data streams.
- Real-world use cases and best practices.

# Rxjs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
